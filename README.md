# 10-Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Business Logo
## Description:
```
Using the command line, the user is prompted for text and can enter up to three characters.

The user is then prompted for text color, they're able to enter a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.

After inputting a color, you receive a list of three shapes to choose from circle, triangle, and square.

After selecting a shape, the user is asked to input the shape color.

When an input has been given for all the prompts,

an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`,

and an output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.

After opening the `logo.svg` file in a browser you get a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria entered. 

```
